# Plot Twist

Plot Twist is a Django web application that allows users to explore and interact with movie information. Users can view details about movies, submit plot twists, vote on existing plot twists, and more.

## Features

- **Movie Search:** Search for movies using the TMDB API.
- **Detailed Movie Information:** View detailed information about movies, including posters, release dates, and plot descriptions.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication system for signup, login, and logout.
- **Plot Twist Submission:** Authenticated users can submit plot twists for different movies.
- **Voting System:** Users can upvote or downvote plot twists submitted by others.

## Technologies Used

- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open source object-relational database system.
- **Heroku & Render:** Cloud platforms for deploying web applications.
- **TMDB API:** An external API used for fetching movie data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Pipenv or virtualenv for managing Python packages
- PostgreSQL installed on your machine or accessible via a cloud provider

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Plot-Twist.git
   cd Plot-Twist



### Future Goals
Plot twist will become more social in the future. Users can comment and debate movies and shows in a new environment on the app. Plot twist will also feature critcal reviews and trailers. 

### Challenges 
Connecting Plot Twist to a front end server was challengning and limited my options in implementing various features before deployment (main concerns were posts and fetches being blocked between the front and backend).
